Here, you'll apply what we've learned to a data set on lobster abundance and sizes, collected from coastal rocky reef sites within the [Santa Barbara Coastal LTER](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/). Unfold the following note to read more about the data before continuing on (collapsed to save space):\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Learn about the data:\n\n#### About SBC LTER\nThe [Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/) (SBC LTER) site was established in 2000 as part of the [LTER Network](https://lternet.edu/) to understand the ecology of coastal kelp forest ecosystems. Research and long-term ecological and environmental monitoring data is collected within a 10,000 square kilometer area of the northern portion of the Southern California Bight, which includes the Santa Barbara Channel, coastal watersheds, small estuaries, and sandy beaches that border the Channel. You can explore the full [data catalog](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/).\n\n#### About the data set\n\nThere are five coastal rocky reef research sites at which the SBC LTER collects long-term monitoring data:\n\n- Naples Reef (NAPL)\n- Isla Vista Reef (IVEE)\n- Arroyo Quemado Reef (AQUE)\n- Mohawk Reef (MOHK)\n- Carpinteria Reef (CARP)\n\nIn January 2012, [Naples Reef](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/MPAs/Naples) and [Isla Vista Reef](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/MPAs/Campus-Point) were [designated as Marine Protected Areas](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=27928) (MPAs), prohibiting any future take of lobsters (along with other living marine resources). Since then, the SBC LTER has conducted annual (late summer) benthic surveys at each of the above five sites, where SCUBA divers record lobster abundance and sizes. Explore the [metadata](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/package/?package=knb-lter-sbc.77) for more information.  \n\n#### Data citation\n\nReed, D, R. Miller. 2023. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (*Panulirus interruptus*), ongoing since 2012 ver 9. Environmental Data Initiative. <https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/3595322687af94cd532620ad9db94c77>. \n\n#### Finding this data set\n\n*Knowing how to search for data can be tricky! Here's how I accessed this particular data set, should you want to search for LTER data yourself, in the future:*\n\n1. **Filter the [SBC LTER Data Catalog](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/)** for data sets related to **Reef/Kelp Forest** habitats (check the box next to the habitat type of interest, or filter by measurement type or LTER Core Research Area). This produces a table of data collections, descriptions, and links to individual data and metadata records.\n2. **Choose a data set of interest.** I was interested in the *SBC LTER: Spiny lobster in California* Collection, which includes three different data sets. I specifically chose, [Lobster abundace, size, and fishing pressure](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/package/?package=knb-lter-sbc.77) -- here, you'll find lots of metadata, including people and organizations involved in this data collection, temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage, methods and protocols, and links to data files. Additionally, you'll see a link to the [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77) (top right corner), which is the data repository that maintains all data and metadata produced by the LTER. EDI assigns a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to each version of a data package (data package = data + metadata; SBC LTER updates this data set each year when new data is collected -- each update receives a new DOI).\n3. **Download or import the data.** You can download the data file from either the [SBC LTER Data Catalog](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/package/?package=knb-lter-sbc.77) *or* the [EDI Data Package](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77). *However* I prefer reading in the data directly from online (that way, I don't need to worry about storing large data files). I recommend doing this from the [EDI Data Package](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77) (rather than the SBC LTER Data Catalog), since the DOI ensures you can re-reference the exact same version, even after the data set is updated with new data (SBC LTER Data Catalog only has a download link for the most up-to-date version of the data). To do so, right click on the *Download Data* button, then select *Copy Link Address*.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/download-lob-data.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUse this url inside `read_csv()` to import the data into your script or Qmd / Rmd file:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlobster_data <- read_csv(\"https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/dataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.9&entityid=f32823fba432f58f66c06b589b7efac6\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n*Your goal is to create a visualization that explores how lobster size differs across each of the five coastal rocky reef SBC LTER sites for the years 2012 (when IVEE and NAPL were established as MPAs) and 2022 (10 years later)*. This will first require some data exploration and wrangling. Some tips (unfold below):\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}\n## Data exploration & wrangling tips\n\n[**Data exploration tips:**]{.body-text-l .dark-blue-text}\n\n- Use `glimpse()` and / or `str()` to check out your variables and data types\n- Extract unique elements using `unique(df$column_name)`\n- Open up the spreadsheet-style data viewer using `View(df)`\n- Be sure to review the [metadata](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.9) (including methods & protocols) to fully understand the data\n\n[**Data wrangling tips:**]{.body-text-l .dark-blue-text}\n\n- I love starting all my cleaning pipelines with `janitor::clean_names()` to convert column headers into lowercase snake_case (not necessary, but easy to implement and super helpful for yourself and others)\n- You'll want to keep just the years of interest\n- Missing size measurements are denoted with `-99999` -- consider how to deal with these\n- Each row is **not** always a single observation, but rather summed lobster counts at each size observed within a site / transect / replicate. You'll want to wrangle the data such that each row represents a single lobster observation. You may need to do some Googling to figure out a solution for this (HINT: you're looking to perform the opposite of `count()`).\n- I often find that I'll need to return to my data wrangling pipeline again *after* I start plotting my data --  it's at this stage that I'll often catch variables that are the wrong data type (e.g. numeric, factor, character) for plotting and need to make the appropriate updates.\n:::\n\n[**(Part 1a) After exploring and wrangling your data, answer the following questions:**]{.teal-text}\n\n- [ ] **1.** What are your variables of interest and what kinds of data (e.g. numeric, categorical, ordered, etc.) are they? [**(a bullet point list here is fine)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] **2.** Using [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/), identify which graphic forms / geoms are appropriate, given your data. List them out. [**(a bullet point list here is fine)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] **3.** Now that you have a list of options, what are some of your considerations as you decide which type of graph create? For example, is it important / valuable to show sample size? Why or why not? How will you represent multiple groups? etc. [**(3-4 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n\nNow that you've explored and starting wrangling your data, it's time to create some plots. It's often important to try out multiple graphic forms (e.g. `geom_*()`s) as you decide which is the most effective way of presenting your data. This process is commonly referred to as **Exploratory Data Analysis or Exploratory Data Visualization**. Some tips (unfold below):\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}\n## Data viz creation tips\n\n[**Data viz creation tips:**]{.body-text-l .dark-blue-text}\n\n- I always find it helpful to sketch things out on paper first\n- There's no need to create anything special or particularly visually-pleasing during this exploratory visualization phase. It *can* be helpful to make minor modifications, (e.g. rearranging groups in a logical order, color groups, etc.) to help you identify any emerging patterns\n- We created a number of different plot types together in class, exploring different geoms and some of the arguments that each ggplot layer can take. Be sure to take a look back at the lecture materials, but also know that you may need to reference documentation and / or online examples to create / modify your intended visualizations.\n:::\n\n[**(Part 1b) Complete the following:**]{.teal-text}\n\n- [ ] Create at least **three** different plots as part of your exploratory data visualization phase to test out which graphic forms / geoms works best. Your last plot should be the version that you feel is best suited for presenting your data. (***NOTE:** Your first two plots do not need to be at all polished -- during the exploratory data visualization phase, we're most concerned with choosing a graphic form / geom(s) for effectively presenting our data.*) \n-  [ ] Consider all three of your plots. What about the graphic forms / geoms used in plots #1 and #2 was not as effective as plot #3? Justify your decision to pursue plot #3. [**(5-8 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] (For plot #3 only) Consider modifications that we discussed in lecture that may make this plot easier to interpret (e.g. updating colors, moving or removing legends, highlighting groups, ordering groups) -- be sure to update your plot as appropriate.\n- [ ] Explain why you chose to make the above modifications. If you chose not to make any of these modifications, why not? [**(3-6 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] Polish your third (final) plot by updating the labels and theme (we'll cover theme modifications during [week 4 discussion section](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/course-materials/week4.html#discussion-materials)). \n- [ ] Describe two or more challenges you encountered while deciding on / creating your plots -- these can be conceptual (e.g. challenges in determining how to best represent your data) and / or technical (e.g. code-based challenges). [**(4-8 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] Add alt text to your final visualization following the formula discussed during [week 2's discussion section](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/course-materials/discussion/week2/week2-alt-text.html#/title-slide) and using the `#| fig-alt:` code chunk option.\n\n## Rubric (specifications)\n\nYou must complete the following, as detailed below, to receive a \"Satisfactory\" mark for Assignment #2, Part I:\n\n**Complete the following steps in your GitHub Classroom repo (`eds240-HW2/Part1.qmd`):**\n\n- [ ] include your preferred name, and if you feel comfortable, your preferred pronouns in the author field of the `Part1.qmd` YAML\n- [ ] answer the three Part 1a questions, adhering to the length requirements specified at the end of each question prompt\n- [ ] create three different plots (two unpolished exploratory data visualizations and one polished final plot) in accordance with Part 1b instructions (**NOTE:** there isn't necessarily a single correct answer here, but your final plot should clearly display the variables of interest and you should be able to justify your choice in your written responses)\n- [ ] code should be clearly organized and annotated following conventions and guidelines outlined in the [Writing clean code](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/clean-code-guide.html) page on the course website\n- [ ] answer the three Part 1b questions, adhering to the length requirements specified at the end of each question prompt\n- [ ] add alt text to your final visualization in accordance with Part 1b instructions\n- [ ] we should be able to run individual lines / chunks of code *and* render `Part1.qmd` without errors\n- [ ] all three plot outputs should appear in your rendered doc\n- [ ] push your completed `Part1.qmd` to GitHub via GitHub Classrooms by 11:59pm PT on Sat 02/03/2024\n\n<br>\n\n::: {.center-text .large-fa-icon .teal-text}\n\n{{< fa chart-line title=\"A simple line chart\" >}} End Part I {{< fa chart-line title=\"A simple line chart\" >}}\n\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n# [Part II: Data wrangling & exploratory data viz using your own data]{.pink-text}\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\n**Note:** This part of HW #2 is a continuation of [HW #1, Part II](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW1.html#part-ii-find-a-data-sets-that-interests-you) and is the next step in working towards your final course assignment. Your final assignment is meant to combine nearly all of the course learning outcomes(!):\n\n- identify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience\n- prepare (e.g. clean, explore, wrangle) data so that it’s appropriately formatted for building data visualizations\n- build effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically `{ggplot2}` + ggplot2 extension packages\n- write code from scratch and read and adapt code written by others\n- apply a DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) lens to the process of designing data visualizations \n\nRead the description, below, for details on what to work on this week.\n\n## Description \n\n*A small part of each homework assignment will be dedicated to working on a series of data visualizations which will be due as part of Assignment #4 at the end of the quarter.* Assignment #4 will ask you to build three related, but different data visualizations -- all which will use the same data set(s), but present those data differently for three different audiences / purposes:\n\n1. **a visualization for a general audience (i.e. without domain expertise)** -- this data visualization may be designed to prompt conversation, clearly display findings (without the use of jargon), display findings in an atypical but creative way,  and / or may blend both art and science\n2. **a visualization to be included in a paper, technical documentation, or report** -- this visualization should tell a story, but can include much more detail, more data, more domain-specific language, etc.\n3. **a visualization that you could include in a presentation** -- you might imagine an audience with familiarity with your domain, but they only have a brief amount of time to process the information being presented; key takeaways should be clearly highlighted, and you may have multiple versions, each with an added layer (as if you're animating pieces of your visualization onto a slide) \n\n[**(Part 2a) This week, you’ll focus on importing / wrangling / and beginning the exploratory data visualization phase, using the data you found as part of [HW #1, Part II](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW1.html#part-ii-find-a-data-sets-that-interests-you). Complete the following:**]{.teal-text} \n\n- [ ] Create an file named, `HW2-exploration.qmd` within your `lastName-eds240-HW4` repo and add appropriate YAML fields\n- [ ] Load necessary packages and read in your data\n- [ ] Clean & wrangle your data\n- [ ] Create at least **four** (but of course feel free to create more!) exploratory visualizations (similar to plot #1 and #2 in Part I of this assignment). \n- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** If you have a downloaded data file saved to your repo (e.g. you're not reading in your data directly from online, from a server, etc.) be sure to add your data folder / file to your `.gitignore`, particularly if this file is large.\n\n[**(Part 2b) After completing the above steps, answer the following questions:**]{.teal-text}\n\n- [ ] **1.** What have you learned about your data? Have any potentially interesting patterns emerged? [**(5-8 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] **2.** In HW #1, you outlined some questions that you wanted to answer using these data. Have you made any strides towards answering those questions? If yes, how so? If no, what next steps do you need to take (e.g. I need to create X plot type, I still need to track down Y data, I need to restructure existing data so that you can visualize it in Z ways, etc.)? [**(8-12 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] **3.** What challenges do you foresee encountering with your data? These can be data wrangling and / or visualization challenges.
