[**Critiquing a data visualization:**]{.teal-text .body-text-l}

1. Identify the primary and secondary insights that the graphic is trying to convey.

. .  .

2. Identify elementary perceptual tasks (e.g. comparing lengths, angles) and what is confusing or difficult to do.

. .  .

3. Identify if it's possible (*and* if it makes sense) to use more effective elementary perceptual tasks for the primary and secondary insights

. .  .

4. Identify points of confusion and decide how those could be addressed (e.g. a different graphic form, rearranging components, including an introduction graph, better annotation)
