[What do we mean by "data wrangling?"]{.slide-title}

<hr>

>*"Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is **the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format** with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics."*

[Wrangling includes (but is not limited to):]{.body-text-m}

- **data cleaning** (e.g. handling missing values, consistent naming of observations, ensuring variables are the correct data types, etc.)
- **restructuring data** (e.g. tidying data (i.e. convert from wide > long format))
- **combining data sets** (e.g. using key values to merge two related data sets)

[`{ggplot2}` plays best with *tidy* data]{.slide-title}

On the left reads 'In tidy data: each variable forms a column; each observation forms a row; each cell is a single measurement.' There is an example table on the lower right with columns ‘id’, ‘name’ and ‘color’ with observations for different cats, illustrating tidy data structure."

The data science workflow, as described by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund in [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro), with added [`{tidyverse}` packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) as they fit within this workflow.

**Note** that there are a number of other non-tidyverse packages that are also incredibly helpful too (e.g. `{janitor}`, `{naniar}`)!

> *Since [launching in 2011](https://www.fracfocus.org/learn/about-fracfocus), **[FracFocus](https://fracfocus.org/) has become the largest registry of [hydraulic fracturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking) chemical disclosures in the US**. The database, available to explore online and [download in bulk](https://fracfocus.org/data-download), contains 210,000+ such disclosures from fracking operators; it details the location, timing, and water volume of each fracking job, plus the names and amounts of chemicals used. The project is [managed](https://fracfocus.org/about-us) by the [Ground Water Protection Council](https://www.gwpc.org/overview/), “a nonprofit 501(c)6 organization whose members consist of state ground water regulatory agencies”. As seen in: The latest [installment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/25/climate/fracking-oil-gas-wells-water.html) of the New York Times’ [Uncharted Water series](https://www.nytimes.com/series/uncharted-waters).*

## {#messy-data data-menu-title="FracFocus' messy data"}

[Download fracking data from Google Drive!]{.slide-title}

**You should already have downloaded these data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vR0Ppc8YaIsHmAOluxeOtmKu1DG_WaR9/view?usp=sharing)**
:::

I *happened* to snag these data back in November 2023 when they were still *quite* messy. Since then, (it seems that) FracFocus has done a bit more pre-processing of these data -- meaning the data you download from their [online portal](https://fracfocus.org/data-download) is already a whole lot cleaner. This is great(!), but also defeats the purpose of this exercise {{< fa face-smile title="smiling face" >}}.

Goals: 

- format date/time column correctly (should be recognized as a datetime object, rather than a character string)
- add a new 'year' column with just the year
- clean up state names (which are *very* messy)
- add a new column of state abbreviations
- get rid of any observations that have missing values in the
